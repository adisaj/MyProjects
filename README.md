# MyProjects
Welcome to my project repository!
These projects represent various work I have done, depicting my entire journey through Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. They range from building models in Machine Learning and Deep Learning to writing insightful data analyses using Python and Power BI. All of this has been driven toward solving real-world problems with data-driven approaches. I hope these projects engage and impact you as much as they did me while I created them.
